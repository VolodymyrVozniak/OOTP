## Introduction
We need to develop an online store where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and place orders. The store will have multiple categories of products, each with its own set of products. Users will be able to search for products, filter them by category, and sort them by price or name. Additionally, users will have to be able to create an account, log in, and track their order status.

## Task Decomposition
To develop the online store, we need to decompose the task into smaller sub-tasks, as follows:

1. Create the basic structure of the online store
2. Define the products and categories
3. Implement a search feature
4. Implement filtering and sorting
5. Implement the shopping cart
6. Implement the order placement feature
7. Implement user authentication
8. Implement order tracking

## Task Decomposition Using Design Patterns
We will use the following design patterns to implement some of the sub-tasks:

1. Iterator pattern for iterating over the products in a category
2. State pattern for managing the order status
3. Chain of Responsibility pattern for handling the order placement feature
