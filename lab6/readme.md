## Introduction
We want to build a chat application that can connect multiple users and allow them to chat with each other. The chat application should be able to handle different types of messages like text, audio, and video. We will use the Interpreter and Mediator design patterns to implement the chat application.

## Requirements
* The chat application should allow multiple users to connect and communicate with each other.
* The users should be able to send different types of messages like text, audio, and video.
* The chat application should support message translation to different languages.
* The chat application should allow users to create chat rooms and invite other users to join them.

## Task Decomposition
* Define classes for users, chat rooms, and messages.
* Implement the Mediator design pattern to manage communication between users and chat rooms.
* Implement the Interpreter design pattern to translate messages to different languages.

## Mediator Design Pattern
* Define a Mediator class to manage communication between users and chat rooms.
* The Mediator class should maintain a list of connected users and chat rooms.
* The Mediator class should have methods to add users and chat rooms.
* The Mediator class should have a send_message method that can broadcast a message to all connected users or send a message to a specific user or chat room.
* The Mediator class should have a method to create chat rooms and invite users to join them.

## Interpreter Design Pattern
* Define an Expression interface that will be used by the Interpreter pattern.
* Define classes that implement the Expression interface for different languages.
* The Interpreter class will use these classes to translate messages to different languages.
