## Introduction
In this technical task, we will be building a simple text editor that allows users to perform several editing operations such as copy, paste and delete. We will implement these operations using the Macrocommands pattern, which allows us to group several related operations into a single command, and the Template Method pattern, which allows us to define the basic structure of an algorithm while allowing its steps to be overridden by subclasses.

## Requirements
* The text editor should allow the user to input text.
* The text editor should allow the user to copy a selected portion of the text.
* The text editor should allow the user to paste the copied text.
* The text editor should allow the user to delete a selected portion of the text.

## Solution
We will implement the text editor using several classes:

* Editor: Represents the main text editor. It contains the text being edited, a cursor position, and a history of editing commands.
* Command: An abstract class that defines the basic structure of a command in the editor. It contains an abstract execute method that will be implemented by subclasses.
* MacroCommand: A subclass of Command that represents a group of related commands. It contains a list of commands that will be executed in order.
* CopyCommand: A subclass of Command that represents the copy command. It copies the selected portion of the text to the clipboard.
* PasteCommand: A subclass of Command that represents the paste command. It pastes the clipboard content to the cursor position.
* DeleteCommand: A subclass of Command that represents the delete command. It deletes the selected portion of the text.
* TextSelection: A class that represents a selection of text in the editor. It contains a start and end position.
