## Objective

Develop a car configuration application that allows users to create customizable cars. The application should support two key features: creating a car from a prototype and building a car using a builder pattern.

## Requirements

- Implement a `Car` class that stores information about the car's make, model, and color.
- Implement a `CarPrototype` class that allows creating new Car instances by cloning an existing prototype.
- Implement a `CarBuilder` class that allows constructing a Car step by step using a builder pattern.
- Create a clear and organized project directory structure with separate folders for the `Car`, `CarPrototype`, and `CarBuilder` classes.
- Create a `main.py` file that demonstrates the usage of the `CarPrototype` and `CarBuilder` classes to create Car instances.
