## Background
An online store needs a product management system to handle their product inventory. The system should allow the store administrators to add new products, update existing products, and remove products that are no longer available. The system should also allow customers to view the available products and place orders.

## Requirements
The product management system should provide the following functionality:

1. Product CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
2. Product search by name or category
3. Order placement
4. View order history

## Task Decomposition
The product management system can be decomposed into the following modules:

1. Product Catalog: This module handles the storage and retrieval of product information. It should provide an interface for adding, updating, and deleting products. It should also provide a method for searching products by name or category.

2. Order Management: This module handles the creation and management of orders. It should provide an interface for placing orders and viewing order history.

3. User Interface: This module provides a graphical user interface for the product management system. It should provide forms for adding and updating products, a product search feature, and a form for placing orders.

## Implementation using Design Patterns
To implement the product management system, we will use the following design patterns:

1. Facade: The facade pattern will be used to provide a simple interface for the product management system. The facade will provide a single interface for adding, updating, and deleting products, placing orders, and searching for products.

2. Proxy: The proxy pattern will be used to provide a secure interface to the product management system. The proxy will authenticate users and authorize them to perform certain actions, such as adding, updating, or deleting products.

3. Bridge: The bridge pattern will be used to separate the user interface from the product catalog and order management modules. The user interface will interact with the product catalog and order management modules through a bridge.
